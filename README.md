# ðŸ“– About

Greetings! This game is my fifth mini-project on Python and also my fifth upload on GitHub.  
As you can tell, this is basically a Wordle clone where you have to try to guess a 5 letter word.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started

**Step 1** - Download and install Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3134/ (scroll down)  
**Step 2** - Download the game files  
**Step 3** - Run the game

# ðŸŽ“ Rules/Mechanics

You will have to try to guess a random 5 letter word by entering 5 letter words.  
The words that you enter will give you hints on what the random word might be.  
  
If any of the letters in your word are in the right position, they will remain unchanged.  
However, if any of the letters are in the wrong spot, but are still present in the word,  
They will have a "?" in front of them.  
Any letters that are not present in the random word will have an "X" in front of them.
